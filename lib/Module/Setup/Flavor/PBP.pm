  [ REPLACE THIS...
  
    The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
    how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
    example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
    that should be understood before the module is installed.
  
    A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
    README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
    archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
    good idea to provide version information here so that people can
    decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

  =head1 NAME
  
  [% module %] - [One line description of module's purpose here]
  
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  This document describes [% module %] version 0.0.1
  
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use [% module %];
  
  =for author to fill in:
      Brief code example(s) here showing commonest usage(s).
      This section will be as far as many users bother reading
      so make it as educational and exeplary as possible.
    
    
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  =for author to fill in:
      Write a full description of the module and its features here.
      Use subsections (=head2, =head3) as appropriate.
  
  
  =head1 INTERFACE 
  
  =for author to fill in:
      Write a separate section listing the public components of the modules
      interface. These normally consist of either subroutines that may be
      exported, or methods that may be called on objects belonging to the
      classes provided by the module.
  
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  =for author to fill in:
      List every single error and warning message that the module can
      generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
      explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
      suggested remedies.

  =head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  
  =for author to fill in:
      A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
      module, including the names and locations of any configuration
      files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
      that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
      configuration language used.
    
  [% module %] requires no configuration files or environment variables.
  
  
  =head1 DEPENDENCIES
  
  =for author to fill in:
      A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
      including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
      the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
      module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]
  
  None.
  
  
  =head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
  
  =for author to fill in:
      A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
      with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
      competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
      limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
      filters are mutually incompatible).
  
  None reported.
  
  
  =head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
  
  =for author to fill in:
      A list of known problems with the module, together with some
      indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
      release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
      does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
      and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
      limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
      (yet) handled, etc.
  
  No bugs have been reported.
  
  Please report any bugs or feature requests to
  C<bug-[% pbp_rt_name %]@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
